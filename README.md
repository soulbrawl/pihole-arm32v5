# About
The project was created with the purpose of using pi-hole on mikrotik hex refresh.
According to [documentation](https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/ROS/pages/84901929/Container) of the manufacturer this model has a limitation to run containers due to the EN7562CT processor.

You can only run containers for the armv5 platform. [Thanks to them for the link to a repository of available containers.](https://hub.docker.com/u/arm32v5)

Thanks to [article](https://podarok66.livejournal.com/24911.html) and the availability of the FTL v5.x binary, this solution allows to run pi-hole for the armv5 platform.

# Mikrotik container
```bash
/container/add remote-image=holynash/pihole-armv5:latest hostname="pihole" interface=veth1 logging=yes root-dir=<storage_path> start-on-boot=yes
# wait to extract
/container/start number=0
```
To access the web interface, open the IP address assigned to the veth1 interface in your browser.

If you're using static IP addresses, be sure to set the Pi-hole container's IP as the DNS server on each client.

If you're using DHCP, go to IP -> DHCP Server -> Networks and set the DNS server to the Pi-hole container's IP.

Enjoy.
